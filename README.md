# Flappy Bird

This is a simple implementation of the popular game Flappy Bird in Python using the Pygame library.

## Game Summary
In this Flappy Bird game, the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between pairs of pipes without hitting them. The bird automatically falls down due to gravity, and the player needs to tap the space bar to flap the birdâ€™s wings and make it rise. The goal is to survive for as long as possible. 

## Game Description

In this version of Flappy Bird:
- Control a bird that continuously falls towards the ground
- Press the spacebar to make the bird flap and move upward
- Navigate through pairs of pipes with gaps at random heights
- The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground
- Score points by successfully passing through pipes
