# Flappy Bird

This is a simple implementation of the popular game Flappy Bird in Python using the Pygame library.

## Game Summary
In this Flappy Bird game, the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between pairs of pipes without hitting them. The bird automatically falls down due to gravity, and the player needs to tap the space bar to flap the birdâ€™s wings and make it rise. The goal is to survive as long as possible. 

In this version of Flappy Bird, players can:
- Make the bird flap its wings using the spacebar
- Navigate through pipes without hitting them
- Restart the game after it ends

The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or hits the ground.

## How to Play

Use the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings and navigate through the pipes. The game will end when the bird collides with a pipe or hits the ground.
